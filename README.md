# A2-Creations-Python-Development-internship2
It is an internship assignment
The script will:

Scrape the RFQ search results page and navigate through all pagination links.
Extract relevant RFQ details (e.g., title, quantity, date, country, RFQ ID, details link).
Save the data to a CSV file.
Create a ZIP file containing the Python script and the CSV output.
Since Alibaba's pages are dynamic and may require JavaScript rendering, I'll use selenium with a headless browser for reliable scraping, along with BeautifulSoup for parsing. I'll also handle pagination and ensure robust error handling.
Notes on the Script:

The script uses selenium to handle dynamic content and BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML.
It assumes RFQ items are contained in elements with class rfq-item and extracts fields like title, quantity, date, country, RFQ ID, and details link. These class names are placeholders based on typical web structures; if Alibaba's RFQ page uses different class names, the script would need adjustment.
Pagination is handled by finding the "next" button and constructing the next page's URL.
Error handling ensures the script continues even if some RFQ items fail to parse.
The output CSV (rfq_data.csv) contains the scraped data, and both the script and CSV are zipped into rfq_scraper_output.zip.
Output CSV Structure:
The CSV will have the following columns: RFQ Title, Quantity, Date Posted, Country, RFQ ID, Details Link. If your template requires different fields, please provide the specific fields, and I can modify the script.

Limitations and Assumptions:

Since I can't access the actual page content due to authentication or dynamic loading, the script uses generic class names (rfq-item, title, etc.). You may need to inspect the actual Alibaba RFQ page (using browser developer tools) to get the correct class names or IDs and update the script accordingly.
The script assumes you have chromedriver installed and compatible with your Chrome browser version. Install it via pip install webdriver-manager or download it manually.
Alibaba may require login or have anti-scraping measures (e.g., CAPTCHA). If authentication is needed, you'll need to add login steps to the script (e.g., using driver.find_element to input credentials).
If the page structure changes or specific fields are missing, the script may need tweaking based on the actual HTML structure.
How to Run:

Install required packages: pip install selenium beautifulsoup4
Ensure chromedriver is installed and in your system PATH.
Run the script: python alibaba_rfq_scraper.py
The script will generate rfq_data.csv and rfq_scraper_output.zip in the same directory.
Output Files:

rfq_data.csv: Contains the scraped RFQ data.
rfq_scraper_output.zip: Contains alibaba_rfq_scraper.py and rfq_data.csv.
